Weekly report draw a selection of issues to check in your code, each week. 

The weekly report draws issues from 5 rules, randomly or chosen specially for that week. The rules of a week are stored on exakat.io, and everyone will work on the same errors. You can work on yours, and then, discuss then with your colleagues, cousins and anyone in the community : they are the focus of the week.  

The selections of the previous weeks, and, the next week are offered. Just be aware that next week's selection may change, without warning. 

If your code is already immune to all this week's rules : good job! You can share you experience with others!
