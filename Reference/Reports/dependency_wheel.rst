Dependency Wheel
________________

The DependencyWheel represents dependencies in a code source.

Dependency Wheel is a javascript visualization of the classes dependencies in the code. Every class, interface and trait are represented as a circle, and every relation between the classes are represented by a link between them, inside the circle. 

It is based on Francois Zaninotto's `DependencyWheel <http://fzaninotto.github.com/DependencyWheel>`_ and the `d3.js <https://github.com/mbostock/d3>`_.
