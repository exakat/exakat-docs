Scoping analysis

Summary

* `scoping files`_
* `scoping rules`_
* `scoping reports`_



Scoping files
----------------------

ignore_dirs and include_dirs are the option used to select files within a folder. Here are some tips to choose 

* From the full list of files, ignore_dirs[] is applied, then include_dirs is applied. The remaining list is processed.
* ignore one file : 
  `ignore_dirs[] = "/path/to/file.php"`

* ignore one dir : 
  `ignore_dirs[] = "/path/to/dir/"`

* ignore siblings but include one dir : 
  `ignore_dirs[] = "/path/to/parent/";`
  `include_dirs[] = "/path/to/parent/dir/"`

* ignore every name containing 'test' : 
  `ignore_dirs[] = "test";`

* only include one dir (and exclude the rest): 
  `include_dirs[] = "/path/to/dir/";`

* omitting include_dirs defaults to `"include_dirs[] = ""`
* omitting ignore_dirs defaults to `"ignore_dirs[] = ""`
* including or ignoring files multiple times only has effect once

include_dirs has priority over the `config.cache` configuration file. If a folder has been marked for exclusion in the `config.cache` file, it may be forced to be included by configuring its value with include_dirs in the `config.ini` file. 

Scoping rules
------------------------------
to be completed




Scoping reports
------------------------------

Exakat builds a list of analysis to run, based on two directives : `project_reports` and `projects_themes`. Both are list of rulesets. Unknown rulesets are omitted. 

project_reports makes sure you can extract those reports, while `projects_themes` allow you to build reports a la carte later, and avoid running the whole audit again.

Required rulesets
#################
First, analysis are very numerous, and it is very tedious to sort them by hand. Exakat only handles 'themes' which are groups of analysis. There are several list of rulesets available by default, and it is possible to customize those lists. 

When using the `projects_themes` directive, you can configure which rulesets must be processed by exakat, each time a 'project' command is run. Those rulesets are always run. 

Report-needed rulesets
######################

Reports are build based on results found during the auditing phase. Some reports, like 'Ambassador' or 'Drillinstructor' needs the results of specific rulesets. Others, like 'Text' or 'Json' build reports at the last moment. 

As such, exakat uses the project_reports directive to collect the list of necessary rulesets, and add them to the `projects_themes` results. 

Late reports
############

It is possible de extract a report, even if the configuration has not been explicitly set for it. 

For example, it is possible to build the Owasp report after telling exakat to build a 'Ambassador' report, as Ambassador includes all the analysis needed for Owasp. On the other hand, the contrary is not true : one can't get the Ambassador report after running exakat for the Owasp report, as Owasp only covers the security rulesets, and Ambassador requires other rulesets. 

Recommendations
###############

* The 'Ambassador' report has all the classic rulesets, it's the most comprehensive choice. 
* To collect everything possible, use the ruleset 'All'. It's also the longest-running ruleset of all. 
* To get one report, simply configure project_report with that report. 
* You may configure several rulesets, like 'Security', 'Suggestions', 'CompatibilityPHP73', and later extract independant results with the 'Text' or 'Json' format.
* If you just want one compulsory report and two optional reports (total of three), simply configure all of them with project_report. It's better to produce extra reports, than run again a whole audit to collect missing informations. 
* It is possible to configure customized rulesets, and use them in project_rulesets
* Excluding one analyzer is not supported. Use custom rulesets to build a new one instead. 

Example
#######

::

    project_reports[] = 'Drillinstructor';
    project_reports[] = 'Owasp';

    project_themes[] = 'Security';
    project_themes[] = 'Suggestions';
    

With that configuration, the Drillinstructor and the Owasp report are created automatically when running 'project'. Use the following command to get the specific rulesets ; 

::

    php exakat.phar report -p <project> -format Text -T Security -v
